# YouthSupremacy

Precepts, memes, and rituals built around the idea of a colony kicking out pawns at a set age. 

The `Youth Supremacy` precept makes pawns unhappy when there are people in the colony at or above the set age (default 18, configurable in settings).

The `Expulsion` ritual will take an of-age pawn, and expel them from the colony, setting them to a random, friendly faction.

Adds an "Orphan wanders in" event. 

Adds a `MechCaretaker` android xenotype to act as a colony caretaker. A mechanitor incapable of all but crafting and social.
